TODO: Find out how robust these glyphs are on the Target platforms.

#		Simply a hash (shift-3) character, just ONE byte


These are two-byte pairs in UTF-8:

¡   inverted exclaimation point   2
§   section   2

The rest of the bunch each require 3 bytes in UTF-8:

…   ellipsis &hellip; (horizontal)
⋮   vertical ellipsis &vellip;
⋰   up right ellipsis &utdot;
⋱   down right ellipsis &dtdot;
⌐   inverted NOT

☟		Hand pointing down
