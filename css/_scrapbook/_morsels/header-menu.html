    <h4>¿why?</h4>
    <p>
      Lucas' example has some extra bits that made it difficult for me to figure out what was
      going on. I need to break things down to the minimum in order to understand. In this case,
      I was able to get this example CSS Menu working, as you see here, with 1,679 characters of
      code (not including this paragraph). That's without any minification or compression. The original example is 6024
      characters,
      plus the Font-Awesome CSS, which is 23KB. Counting characters of source code is a stupid habit,
      but it is some measure of how simple I need things to be in order to understand them.

      Super thanks to Lucas Bebber. Please take a look at his examples: note especially his
      interplay of CSS and SVG Filters, which is very cool. Font Awesome is likewise super.
      It's just more than I need for this here demo.
