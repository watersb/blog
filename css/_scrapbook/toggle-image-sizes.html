    <p>When I was a kid, I <em>loved</em> computers. Video games and computers were just getting started. They were full of promise, and how this was going to be great. Just keep the cursor moving, racing the beam, and we know we will all be some place beyond imagination. So fast!</p>

    <p>How fast? Doubling every year. Year after year, we could expect great things.</p>

      <p>So much work to be done, on those primitive machines, to get where we wanted to be. But it was quite
        gratifying. A small space can be frustrating, but any improvement is big progress. My small kitchen looks like
        the picture of despair when it gets messy, but it takes only a short while to clean up again.</p>

    <p>Small. is beautiful.</p>

    <p>So they got better.</p>

    <p>The Smalltalk issue. Oh my God. That was mind-blowing.

        have a rock band poster on my wall. I had the Macintosh Design Team.
