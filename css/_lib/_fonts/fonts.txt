Notes on Fonts and other typography


## TLDR

Good serif fonts are very rare. Fonts that do well across
 a wide variety of scree sizes, resolutions  densities.

Free web font superfamilies with great serif faces, comes
down to Adobe Source, IBM Plex, Noto and perhaps some variants
of Merriweather.

In my tests, the 180 - 500KB font streams aren't super better
than the native font stacks chosen here. In particular, I
find that default font values on Android Chrome are very
good, and right there is half your audience. Other platforms
seem required to stick with defaults from PostScript printer
legacy, yet native choices still ship on iOS. Both macOS and
Windows 10 have some good font options and superb rendering
engines. The story on Linux desktop is equivocal...

Web fonts are better than ever. [Google Fonts] has commissioned
and embarrassment of riches.

## Font Stacks

### Windows
     mono:  consolas, monospace;
    serif:  "Georgia Pro", "Georgia", serif;
     sans:  "Bahnschrift", "Arial Nova", "Arial", sans-serif;


Variable Font options might be:

     sans:  Bahnschrift";
    serif:  "Sitka FV";
     mono:  ;

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/bahnschrift

https://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/201310.html

"Sitka" is a good choice, the most built-in options
of an of the fonts shipped with Windows 10 consumer
builds (as of 2020-02-03). But *note* that, unlike
Variable Font demo web font, the "pack-in" version
ships as a separate font-family for each of the
optical sized variants. The "superfamily" name
`Sitka`
is *not* sufficient. Instead, as it ships with the
current Windows 10, use
`Sitka Text`.

aside: a nice project would be to come up with a style
sheet that uses each of the Sitka font variants as
appropriate for that size. `Sitka Display` etc.

The only other font with so many optical sizes to which
I have access at the moment is `Warnock Pro`, an Adobe
TrueType font developed to honor Adobe founder
John Warnock, and inspired by Mr. Warnock's handwriting.

│   Windows:
│     Sitka is the default font for Reader Mode in Edge.
│     Sitka automatically supports [optical scaling], which can increase
│     legibility over a wide range of sizes display pixel densities. So
│     Sitka is my first choice.
│     BUT!
│     Sitka does not render on non-Microsoft browsers on Windows, and
│     is not available on other platforms (as of 2018-09-11).
│     BUT!
│     Microsoft distributes a variant of Sitka via their
│     [Microsoft Fluent Fonts] package, in order to
│     [enhance readability] for some forms of dyslexia.
│     This is a desktop-system font package distribution,
│     *not* a live web-font. And it destroys the layout in order
│     to aid those who have problem reading closely-spaced
│     characters.
│     BUT!
│     Microsoft has also published a [Variable Fonts Demo] as part of
│     their [Microsoft Edge Web Demonstrations] site. That demo serves
│     up a [web-font subset of Sitka], which seems to render on current
│     web browsers on the platforms I have tested (macOS, Fedora, Windows).

│   Other Options for Windows:
│     [Georgia]
│     I know. It may be hip to hate on Georgia for its ubiquity, but
│     Matthew Carter is a genius and Georgia is still a great font for
│     serif body text. There are some clumsy bits in there, a lack of
│     ligatures that irritate me a bit, but it can be a very effective
│     face for paragraphs. Which is a great bonus, as Georgia is of
│     course everywhere as one of the [Microsoft Core Web Fonts].
│
│     [Georgia Pro]
│     This is not a joke. Georgia Pro really is a welcome update to a
│     great font. Metrics are tweaked, standard OpenType extensions
│     like ligatures and alternate characters, more font weights like
│     thin, condensed, and extra-bold. A labor of love for Microsoft
│     Typography and Matthew Carter, available at no cost for personal
│     use on Windows from the Windows Store, and for crazy amounts of
│     money from its foundry, [Carter & Cone].

## Android

     Noto
     Roboto
     Droid

## Linux

By far, the most widely used Linux desktop distribution
must certianly be Google's ChromeOS. Google commissioned
a number of fonts to provide metric compatability with
Microsoft Office and webfonts.

     Tinos
     Carlito
     Arimo
     Cousine

Next would probably be Ubuntu in non- "enterprise" usage.

I imagine that some variant of RedHat would be the most
likely candidate for IT managed desktops. Which one probably
depends upon the support contract.

### GNOME basic fonts, LibreOffice

I have no idea. I see DejaVu, Nimbus, Liberation, in addition
to the fonts chosen for non-Latin scripts.

`DejaVu Serif, DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Sans Mono`

A very nice superfamily with a large x-height. Notable
for the harmony across the serif, sans, and monospace fonts.

The `Nimbus` and `Liberation` families have font metrics more
in line with Postscript Office setups like Times, Courier.
They work well, but at the moment they would require an
additional boosted x-height (ems) setting of 125%, so a
20px base design size rather than 16. Not in line with the
screen font choices on the other platforms.
