Notes on Fonts and other typography

## Font Stacks

### Windows
     mono:  consolas, monospace;
    serif:  "Georgia Pro", "Georgia", serif;
     sans:  "Bahnschrift", "Arial Nova", "Arial", sans-serif;


Variable Font options might be:

     sans:  Bahnschrift";
    serif:  "Sitka FV";
     mono:  ;

"Sitka" is a good choice, the most built-in options
of an of the fonts shipped with Windows 10 consumer
builds (as of 2020-02-03). But *note* that, unlike
Variable Font demo web font, the "pack-in" version
ships as a separate font-family for each of the
optical sized variants. The "superfamily" name
`Sitka`
is *not* sufficient. Instead, as it ships with the
current Windows 10, use
`Sitka Text`.

aside: a nice project would be to come up with a style
sheet that uses each of the Sitka font variants as
appropriate for that size. `Sitka Display` etc.

The only other font with so many optical sizes to which
I have access at the moment is `Warnock Pro`, an Adobe
TrueType font developed to honor Adobe founder
John Warnock, and inspired by Mr. Warnock's handwriting.


## Android

     Noto
     Roboto
     Droid

## Linux

By far, the most widely used Linux desktop distribution
must certianly be Google's ChromeOS. Google commissioned
a number of fonts to provide metric compatability with
Microsoft Office and webfonts.

     Tinos
     Carlito
     Arimo
     Cousine

Next would probably be Ubuntu in non- "enterprise" usage.

I imagine that some variant of RedHat would be the most
likely candidate for IT managed desktops. Which one probably
depends upon the support contract.

### GNOME basic fonts, LibreOffice

I have no idea. I see DejaVu, Nimbus, Liberation, in addition
to the fonts chosen for non-Latin scripts.

`DejaVu Serif, DejaVu Sans, DejaVu Sans Mono`

A very nice superfamily with a large x-height. Notable
for the harmony across the serif, sans, and monospace fonts.

The `Nimbus` and `Liberation` families have font metrics more
in line with Postscript Office setups like Times, Courier.
They work well, but at the moment they would require an
additional boosted x-height (ems) setting of 125%, so a
20px base design size rather than 16. Not in line with the
screen font choices on the other platforms.
