# I lost my freaking mind
August 11, 2018

When I was a kid, I *loved* computers. Video games and computers were just getting started. They were full of promise, and how this was going to be great. Just keep the cursor moving, [racing the beam](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/racing-beam), and we know we will all be some place beyond imagination. So fast!

How fast? [Doubling every year. Year after year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law), we could expect great things.

So much work to be done, on those primitive machines, to get where we wanted to be. But it was quite gratifying. A small space can be frustrating, but any improvement is big progress. My small kitchen looks like the picture of despair when it gets messy, but it takes only a short while to clean up again.

Small. is beautiful.


So they got better.


The [BYTE Smalltalk issue](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-08). Oh my God. That was mind-blowing.

Larry Tesler, Bruce Horn, Alan Kay, Susan Kare, Bill Atkinson... Seriously, these names. I didn't have a rock band poster on my wall. I had the [Macintosh Design Team](https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-02/1984_02_BYTE_09-02_Benchmarks#page/n59).

When I was in college, I learned about Unix. I had selected my university in part because of its Unix legacy: the Berkeley Standard Distribution (BSD).

When I was a kid, I was fascinated by computers. Small, "personal" computers were just becoming available, and wow did I want to get one. Two of my best friends had the same mania;

[ the third was unimpressed with what was available, but he was a mathematician. You can't do much about those folks, they are quite happy with a pencil and paper. And much later, my last dance with academia (so far), I came to understand this attitude: mathematics was far more flexible than most ways of talking to a computer. ]

and we became even more deranged when one of us brought the [Grimoire of Awesome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games) to school one day.

[ there is a modern version of this for Small BASIC, https://www.computerscienceforkids.com/smallbasiccomputergames/]

Jeff managed to finagle his family into getting the Apple II. Steve's Dad was a dentist, and sprung for a TRS-80 Model III, with the maxed-out 48KB of RAM. There was some software package available that was supposed to help with billing or something, all very sensible.


 My parents went all in one Christmas, and we brought home the best computer we could afford: a [Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Color_Computer).


My friends laughed at its notion of "color graphics". the CoCo was essentially a [teletext terminal](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=http://www.colorcomputerarchive.com/coco/Documents/Manuals/Hardware/TRS-80%2520Videotex%2520Terminal%2520Owner%27s%2520Manual%2520(Tandy).pdf&ved=2ahUKEwjOzKvw1YLdAhUCb60KHVjTDngQFjADegQIBxAB&usg=AOvVaw1KeDSyKJirNEdahmbD3WI5&cshid=1535010057009) that had the dial-up telephone modem removed. Designed to display a stock-ticker-like crawl on a standard NTSC television. The Radio Shack people tried to pass it off as a games console, stripping out the modem and shoving a hardware ROM cartridge onto the side of the thing. My friends were not fooled, and I wsa a bit bewildered about what exactly was to be done about it. I couldn't get a floppy disk drive for it, which would have doubled the cost. I had to grow where I was planted.


As it turns out, I had been fortunate. However awkward the Tandy CoCo might have been as a home entertainment device, it was the optimal platform for helping me learn to program computers. The Motorola 6809 CPU is considered to be one of the best designs of the 8-bit microcomputer era, with a clean instruction set, an architecture almost 16-bit-like. The highly-regarded MC68000 CPU grew out of the design legacy of the MC6809. What's more, the hardware design supported some sweet software: the Microsoft Extended Color BASIC that shipped with the Color Computer included some commands that did not make it into the first shipment of the mighty IBM PCs.


Those days, BYTE Magazine was a monthly Sears-catalog, phone-book-sized chunk of glossy color amazing. Our 8th-grade Language Arts teacher would walk us over to the public library, and we were supposed to do research for a term paper. The idea was to teach us to write a report, complete with standard footnotes and a bibliography, a way of graduating to the next level beyond the time-honored approach of simply cribbing from the World Book Encyclopedia. I found a great book on fundamental digital electronics, logic gates and such. But mostly I would just sit down with an issue of BYTE magazine. None of it made any sense at all, a technical universe of jargon. It didn't matter. I just kept reading, and after a few weeks I could follow along.


Even better, in those days, the most common way to distribute home-computer program was to publish the BASIC source code at the end of a short article discussing the program. You had to copy it over from paper, at times many pages of the stuff. And of course, one typo and the program would not work. I had to read the source, and keep my hands on the keyboard to type it all in. You had to really want to do this.

I lusted after the amazing computers that adorned the pages of the BYTE advertisements and articles: high-resolution graphics, keyboards, disk drives hard and floppy, super-expensive and full of hope. But I knew that they lacked some essential usefulness. Home computers like mine were not the sort of thing to use for writing my term paper.


Then. The Smalltalk Issue happened. I lost my freaking mind.


The bitmapped graphical user interface of the Smalltalk system, its way of encouraging a flexible, extendable software base, the fonts and graphics on the page, the menu-driven mouse interactions... it was mind-blowing. However lovely the Lisp Machines antecedents, those boxes lacked the immediate now-ness of the GUI Smalltalk environment.


Then. The Apple Lisa happened. I lost my freaking mind.


Never mind the price tag -- which was an unthinkable $10,000 in the penurious 1980's -- the Apple Lisa was not a laboratory prototype, but rather a commercial product shipping from a mass-market, wildly successful small-computer company. The shape of the things to come seemed obvious.


Then. The Apple Macintosh happened. I lost my freaking mind.


The Mac cut the price of the Lisa in half, and featured a tightly-optimized system architecture. The whole approach was fascinating to me. I loved the whole-systems discussion as presented in the BYTE Mac issue. February 1984.


[ at some point, talk about an essential idea espoused by the Mac design team: the sealed-box computer device, expandable not by a hardware card bus but rather via high-speed serial ports. Firewire, USB,  Thunderbolt are all variations on this theme. Even when Apple shipped a Mac that had a hardware bus for expansion cards, they used an expensive, multi-master smart-device architecture. NuBus.


Also note that USB grew into a similar architecture after "On The Go" USB turned devices into little bus-mastering computers. ]

While all this was going down, a Microsoft engineer published an intriguing article in BYTE about a powerful approach to software composition: the UNIX shell. It was possible to chain the output of one program into the input of another, in a standard, dynamic way.


At the time, CP/M was the de-facto standard operating environment for every real, practical small computer.For All the mind-blowing innovation that kept things super exciting for me, the rate of industry churn was too fast for businesses to build upon. Well, not quite, but it was a time of disruption, and business applications needed some standard platform. CP/M.


The Unix shell, the C programming language, the collection of small programs that could be pieced together -- yeah, CP/M had little of that. It seemed clear that the first vendor past the post with a UNIX for microcomputers would form the core of the next round of innovation. Any UNIX to do so would displace Microsoft DOS as the emerging standard platform. So Microsoft shipped Xenix.


Required a hard disk. Required system resources that led customers to ignore it in droves. Microsoft had some of the best programmers in the world, but UNIX was simply designed for computers the size of a refrigerator, a full 42-U 19-inch rack. UNIX was the future, sure, ok, but those computers were getting booted out the door as IBM PCs invaded business offices everywhere. Mostly people just wanted to type something on the screen, and to print the resulting documents on paper. Multi-user, networked computers didn't matter.


Then the laser printer happened. I lost my freaking mind.

The NeXT computer. I lost my freaking mind.
