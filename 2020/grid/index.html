        When I was a kid, I loved computers. Video games and computers were just
        getting started. They were full of promise, it was going to be insanely
        great. Just keep the cursor moving,
        <a href="#racing_the_beam">racing the beam</a>, and we know we will all
        be some place beyond imagination. So fast!

        So much work to be done, on those primitive machines, to get where we
        wanted to be. But it was quite gratifying. A small space can be
        frustrating, but any improvement is big progress. My small kitchen looks
        like the picture of despair when it gets messy, but it takes only a
        short while to clean up again. Small is often beautiful.

        Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data, graphs,
        and figures are kept with the text that discusses them.
        <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
        <input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
        <span class="marginnote">
          This is a margin note. There are at least two ways to implement the toggle nature
          of margin notes: hidden-checkbox and summary-detail. Hidden-checkbox uses an HTML
          form element, <code>checkbox</code>, and then hides the checkbox with CSS. As long 
          as I remember to also set appropriate ARIA attributes, I guess it works, but it is 
          something of a hack. So I prefer <code>summary</code> and <code>detail</code> markup,
          which also has a toggle (two-phase) state, but more closely models the semantics of
          the desired result.
        </span>
        In print, this
        means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the web, that means
        readability of graphics and their accompanying text without extra
        clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.
