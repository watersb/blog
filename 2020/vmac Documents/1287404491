A Lesson in ParsimonyLast night, I saw a reference to fonts installed on the original Macintosh, the 1984-era system software, that only a small handful of fonts were available. Given today's rich desktop environments, with hundreds of fonts, rich Unicode support, and advanced typography, I had a hard time accpeting the statement. Six fonts? Really?I have an old Macintosh in the closet, actually, a PowerBook of some sort or another. Unfortunately, it is busted. Fortunately, these days computers can pretend to be other computers, and I use the excellent and simple Mini vMac to run old System software.
