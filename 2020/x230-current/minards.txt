Drawn up by M. Minard, Inspector General of Bridges and Roads in retirement.
----
Paris, November 20, 1869.

The numbers of men present are represented by the widths of the colores zones at a rate of one millimeter for every thousand men; they are further written across
the zones. The red designates the men who enter into Russia, the black those who leave it. ____ The information which has served to draw up the map has been extracted
from the works of M.M. Chiers, of Ségur, of Fezensac, of Chambray and the unpublished diary of Jacob, the pharmacist of the Army since October 28th.
In order to better judge with the eye the diminuition of the army, I have assumed that the troops of Prince Jérôme and of Marshal Devoust who had been detached at Minsk
and Mohilow adn have rejoined around Orscha and Vitebsk, has always marched with the army.
