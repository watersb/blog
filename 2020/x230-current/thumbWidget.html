          When I was a kid, I loved computers. Video games and computers were
          just getting started. They were full of promise, it was going to be
          insanely great. Just keep the cursor moving,
          <a href="#rtb">racing the beam,</a>
          and we know we will all be some place beyond imagination. So fast!

          <h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
          <p>
            Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data,
            graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In
            print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the
            web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text
            without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Figures should try to use the <code>figure</code> element, which by
            default are constrained to the main column. Don’t wrap figures in a
            paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin
            note inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should
            introduce a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like
            so:
          </p>

          <figure class="marginnote">
            <img
              src="marginfigure.png"
              alt="an example graph of scatterplot from R Studio"
            />
            <figcaption>
              <details open>
                <summary>This is a Margin Note</summary>
                <p>
                  The R package provides two custom hooks for figure placement.
                  The first is marginfigure. Set
                  <code>marginfigure = TRUE</code> in a chunk option to place a
                  figure in the right margin. Optionally, specify the figure
                  size and include a caption. Captions are passed as strings
                  through <code>fig.cap</code> in the chunk options.
                </p>
              </details>
            </figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s
            work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a
            text.
            <label for="mn-process-nodes" class="margin-toggle">•</label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              id="mn-process-nodess"
              class="margin-toggle"
            />
            In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most appropriate. To
            place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or whatever) in a
            margin note inside a <code>p</code> tag, as seen to the right of
            this paragraph.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you need a full-width figure, give it the
            <code>fullwidth</code> class. Make sure that’s inside an
            <code>article</code>, and it will take up (almost) the full width of
            the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s
            English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From
            <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>, page 122-124.
          </p>
          <a href="Minards_Map.svg">
            <figure class="fullwidth">
              <img
                src="napoleons-march.jpg"
                alt="Figurative map of the successive losses of the French Army in the Russian campaign, 1812-1813"
              />
            </figure>
          </a>
          <p>
            One obstacle to creating elegant figures on the web is the
            difficulty of handling different screen sizes, especially on the
            fly. Embedded <code>iframe</code> elements are particularly
            troublesome. For these instances we provide a helper class,
            <code>iframe-wrapper</code>, the most common use for which is
            probably YouTube videos...
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use this class on a <code>div</code> instead of a
            <code>figure</code>, with slightly different results but the same
            general effect. Experiment and choose depending on your application.
