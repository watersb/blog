When I was a kid, I <em>loved</em> computers.  Video games and
computers were just getting started.  They were full of promise, it
was going to be insanely great.  Just keep the cursor moving, and we
know we will all be some place beyond imagination.  So fast!

One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive
      use of sidenotes.
      <label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
      <input type="checkbox" id="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"
       class="margin-toggle">
      <span class="sidenote">This is a
  sidenote.</span>
      Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force
the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead
display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their
use in this document already. You are very astute.

How fast?

      <p>So much work to be done, on those primitive machines, to get
        where we wanted to be. But it was quite gratifying. A small
        space can be frustrating, but any improvement is big
        progress. My small kitchen looks like the picture of despair
        when it gets messy, but it takes only a short while to clean
        up again.  Small is often beautiful.

<h2 id="figures">Figures</h2>
<p>Tufte emphasizes tight integration of graphics with text. Data,
graphs, and figures are kept with the text that discusses them. In
print, this means they are not relegated to a separate page. On the
web, that means readability of graphics and their accompanying text
without extra clicks, tab-switching, or scrolling.</p>

<p>Figures should try to use the <code>figure</code> element, which by
default are constrained to the main column. Don’t wrap figures in a
paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note
inside the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce
a figure directly into the main flow of discussion, like so:</p>

<figure class="marginnote">
    <img src="marginfigure.png"
   alt="an example graph of scatterplot from R Studio">
    <figcaption>
      <details open>
  <summary>This is a Margin Note</summary>
  <p>
    The R package provides two custom hooks for figure
    placement. The first is marginfigure. Set <code>marginfigure
    = TRUE</code> in a chunk option to place a figure in the
    right margin. Optionally, specify the figure size and
    include a caption. Captions are passed as strings
    through <code>fig.cap</code> in the chunk options.
    </p>
</figure>

<p>But tight integration of graphics with text is central to Tufte’s
work even when those graphics are ancillary to the main body of a
  text.
  <label for="mn-process-nodes" class="margin-toggle">•</label>
  <input type="checkbox" id="mn-process-nodess" class="margin-toggle">
 In many of those cases, a margin figure may be most
appropriate. To place figures in the margin, just wrap an image (or
whatever) in a margin note inside a <code>p</code> tag, as seen to the
right of this paragraph.</p>

<p>If you need a full-width figure, give it the <code>fullwidth</code> class. Make sure that’s inside an <code>article</code>, and it will take up (almost) the full width of the screen. This approach is demonstrated below using Edward Tufte’s English translation of the Napoleon’s March data visualization. From <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>, page 122-124.</p>
  <figure class="fullwidth">
    <img src="napoleons-march.jpg" alt="Figurative map of the successive losses of the French Army in the Russian campaign, 1812-1813">
  </figure>
<p>One obstacle to creating elegant figures on the web is the difficulty of handling different screen sizes, especially on the fly. Embedded <code>iframe</code> elements are particularly troublesome. For these instances we provide a helper class, <code>iframe-wrapper</code>, the most common use for which is probably YouTube videos...</p>
<p>You can use this class on a <code>div</code> instead of
a <code>figure</code>, with slightly different results but the same
general effect. Experiment and choose depending on your
application.</p>
