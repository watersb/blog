    Boyd Waters
     - I write the words, tweak the software, create almost all of the images.
       Stuff from elsewhere should have proper attribution. If you see something
       that needs correction, please tell me.

    Huge thanks to Daniel Robbins, https://funtoo.org, for hosting this web site.


# TECHNOLOGY COLOPHON

    I use this blog as an excuse to learn some new things, and find that I mostly
    hang on to old ways, too. Much work from first principles, writing the HTML
    and CSS without any frameworks besides the stuff I cook up myself. That's
    not something that should be done in the real world, but I assume that a
    workflow will precipitate out of all this eventually.

    These services are available for generally no money as of 2020 February.
    The closed-source platforms, macOS and Windows, each have their ways of
    turning your usage into dollars. Google is an advertising and media company.
    Even so, I find it remarkable how rich our tools have become, available
    for free or for a nominal charge. Panic Coda is a paid iOS and macOS app
    that is a fantastic value. Funtoo is a great web host.

    Much of what I write about concerns the particular techniques that I
    use to get the words onto the screens into which we gaze.

    Be excellent to one another.
