<p>ABOUT</p>

<p>I am a mostly-retired computer programmer in northern New Mexico.</p>

<p>25 years ago, I wrote some JavaScript. It does some of the things that wanted back then, so that turned out OK. Around that time, the joke in Silicon Valley was the job postings for five years of Java experience. Java hadn't been around for that long. Try explaining that to HR. What a madhouse.</p>

<p>Of course, things are totally different now.</p>

<p>I wound up in New Mexico because I love it, the traffic isn't as bad, and there are still lots of tech jobs and interesting projects. Remote, dark desert skies have long attracted star-watchers, and when a job opened up for a programmer for the VLA upgrade project, I was very happy to run out here and learn more about telescopes and the people who use them. As a kid in the swamps of south Georgia (the province of the United States, not the island), I read science fiction and BYTE magazine, and wanted to be an astronomer. Or a computer programmer. So that was great.</p>

<p>Living in small-town New Mexico, I had ample opportunity to learn how lousy I am at computer programming, Or astronomy, and many other things besides. I became fascinated with this lack that we seem to have. An engineering culture can protect us against some forms of nonsense, at the expense of larger amounts of bureaucracy; true effectiveness seems to be a side-effect of small, motivated, experienced teams. A hard thing to scale. I'm sure you know more about this than I do.</p>

<p>Text, design, and photographs on this site were created by me, or should have a reference to the source of the material.</p>

<p>The cranium logo is in fact an adaptation from a scan of my own head. That's my brain you're looking at. Aside from some odd lumps, it is apparently unremarkable. I processed the original DICOM data via OsiriX, exported photo slices to PhotoShop, then traced them to get some rough SVG files. Lots of fiddling into some optimized shapes. More about that some other time. While I did not produce the DICOM scans myself, I did grow the head in the picture. (I'm not sure how one would go about running a CAT scanner from the inside, but I bet people have tried to do so somewhere. It's a big world.)</p>

<p>I use some variation of this head shot for most of my online communication, but here you can see a photo of me taken using light at wavelengths that are visible to the unaided human eye. Sometimes I resemble the photo. However, for my Twitter account, this wonderful photo of our beloved Stinky the Wonder Dog is simply too awesome to replace any time soon. Alas, we lost Stinky this past year, but I assure you he was well-loved and far more deserving of your Internet attention that I will ever be.</p>

<p>The footer photo is of course an image of the Karl Jansky Very Large Array radio telescope. I assure you, it is indeed Very Large. You should come see it for yourself.</p>
