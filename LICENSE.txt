This web site is a blog, where I write things. Unless otherwise specified, I am the sole creator of the text and images served by this web site.

I could not have created this site without a multitude of other people who have licensed their work for my use. So I would like you to be free to re-use the words and images you encounter on this web site.

In developing the HTML code of this site, I started with the HTML5 Boilerplate framework.

I probably removed a good bit of it, as I chose to avoid most automated-build tools. But anyway, the HTML5 Boilerplate license, included in this LICENSE.txt file of their original distribution, looks like this:
